# SkipList-Implementation

The Repo contains a naive implementation of SkipList written in Java
that supports dynamic addition, deletion of node and search in SkipList

SkipList although is not as popular as alternatives such as Balanced Tree:
Red Black Tree or B Trees, it is still used in many applications such as
Redis zset, as SkipList can be better at range query compared to Balanced Trees.
